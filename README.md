## Abstract
Plants with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have long been associated with a specialized anatomy, including succulence and thick photosynthetic tissues, but quantitative boundaries between non-CAM and CAM plants have yet to be established. We measured photosynthetic anatomy using novel computer vision software and combined them with published data across flowering plants. We then used machine learning and phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate relationships between CAM and anatomy. We found significant differences in photosynthetic tissue anatomy between plants with different CAM phenotypes. Machine learning based classification was over 95% accurate in predicting non-CAM and CAM phenotypes and phylogenetic comparative analyses revealed that CAM evolution was significantly correlated with increased mesophyll cell size, thicker leaves, and decreased intercellular airspace. Our findings suggest that machine learning models may be used for the discovery of new CAM species and that the evolutionary trajectory from non-CAM to strong, obligate CAM requires continual anatomical specialization.
